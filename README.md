# My React Portfolio

## What's on it and how it was built.

### Technologies used

- [ReactJS](https://react.dev/) for base frontend development
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for CSS
- [Framer-Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for interactive effects

### The website

This site is built with the aim of showcasing some of my skills and experiences, and as a landing page to my professional character.
It is split into three main pages:

1. Landing screen —— to say hello!
2. Experiences and skills —— I categorized my familiar skills into certain key experiences. I decided to forgo my little personal projects as they aren't all that impressive, but they can be viewed on my legacy website. Visit that if you wish...
3. Contact page —— in case you want to hire me at your super cool company.

### Responsiveness

I've made a reasonable attempt at responsive design so the website should be at least legible on mobile, albeit not the nicest. With Tailwind, responsive specifications were super easy. Bless this library.

### Future

When I have more time, I'd love to make this website more perfectly responsive, hold more content (pop-ups?), and of course, prettier. I've only scraped the surface of what Framer-Motion can do for a developer, and I'll certainly be exploring more of it.
